# iOS Developer Task

Welcome üëã this document is intended to be used as a guide to the task provided - it‚Äôs important to note that there is no right or wrong answer here and to take as long as you need.

Using Swift please build a small image sharing application. You should use an existing free image API such as imgur or equivalent. This exercise tests your ability to use a REST API, json data and iOS UI elements.

## App requirements

- Home page showing the most popular images from imgur
- The home page should have a search bar that the user can type into to search for images on imgur e.g. yoda
- Search results should be presented in a tiled format, use paging in the API query to retrieve more results as the user scrolls down the list (‚Äúininite scroll‚Äù)
- Tapping an image should navigate to a screen showing a larger view with details about the image (Optional: and the option to favourite an image)
- You should write your code in a way that it can be tested using unit tests and include unit tests in your application
    
## Optional

- The app should give quick access to favourite images with an option to remove an image from favourites
- The app should give quick access to recent searches with an option to clear the search history
    
## Out of scope

- Sign up/registration
- Store favourites / recent searches using the API - locally is ine
- Production readiness - basic setup etc is ine.
    
Please take the time you need to produce a solution you are happy with. Once you are done, the next step is sharing a git repo link with us for evaluation.
    
Good luck! ü§ñ
